## September 2023 - January 2024

The goal: stabilization and Flet 1.0 launch.

* Unified packaging for all platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS, web, iOS and Android - based on `serious_python` and Flutter SDK.
* Speed optimizations (pages with a lot of controls, large updates).
* Adaptive UI - adaptive controls that change their look depending on the platform the app runs.
* Responsive UI - layouts that adapt to a device screen size.
* Localization.
* Extensibility:
  * How to integrate 3rd-party Flutter packages to your apps.
  * How to use 3rd-party Python packages in iOS and Android apps.
* Documentation improvements.
* Bugfixing.
* Test suite.
* Website updates: clearer message, Flet features.
* Flet Packaging and Deployment Service aka Flet CI.
